# Water-Consumption-CC


This C++ program processes multiple test cases and checks whether each input number is **greater than or equal to 2000**. Here's a concise explanation of its working:

### How it works:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t` — the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a `while` loop that runs `t` times.
3. In each iteration, it reads an integer `x`.
4. If `x` is **greater than or equal to 2000**, it prints `"Yes"`.
5. Otherwise, it prints `"no"` (note: lowercase).

### Example Input and Output:

**Input:**

```
3
1999
2000
2500
```

**Output:**

```
no
Yes
Yes
```
