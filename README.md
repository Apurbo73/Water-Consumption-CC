### Water Consumption CC:


This C++ program processes multiple test cases and checks whether each input number is **greater than or equal to 2000**. Here's a concise explanation of its working:

### How it works:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t` â€” the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a `while` loop that runs `t` times.
3. In each iteration, it reads an integer `x`.
4. If `x` is **greater than or equal to 2000**, it prints `"Yes"`.
5. Otherwise, it prints `"no"` (note: lowercase).

### Example Input and Output:

**Input:**

```
3
1999
2000
2500
```

**Output:**

```
no
Yes
Yes
```

## Approach:
This program takes a number of test cases as input and then checks, for each case, whether a given number is greater than or equal to 2000. It uses a loop that runs once for each test case, reading an integer and applying a simple conditional check.

If the input number is 2000 or more, the program outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "no". The logic is straightforward and demonstrates basic use of input/output, loops, and conditionals in C++ for decision-making tasks.
